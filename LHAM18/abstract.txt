title:
Performance evaluation and visualization of scientific applications using PMlib

abstract:
The sustained computational performance of a scientific application on a HPC
system can be often much lower than the maximum system performance.
Understanding this gap requires multi-perspective analysis, i.e.
the perspective in system architecture where the relational characteristics
of the micro architecture elements are important,
and the perspective in applications where the theoretical computation
represented in the source code is compiled into much heavier workload.
An open source library PMlib help users address such synthetic analysis.
PMlib provides the way to report the numerical workload count in the source
code, as well as the actual workload executed on the system captured by
hardware performance counters(HWPC).
It also provides the processor specific hardware utilization report
including the categorized SIMD instruction statistics, the layered cache
hit/miss rate, and the corresponding bandwidth up to memory.
Through the use of PMlib, users can conduct synthetic analysis of the
application performance, and obtain the hint for further optimized execution
of the application.
